**Subject: Request for Sign-off on New System and Next Steps**

Dear [Recipient's Name],

It has been one month since the introduction of the new system, and we have already held a briefing session on this topic. The new system is set to replace the DRRS in 2025, and moving forward, the annual attestation will no longer be conducted using the Excel-based DRRS.

Please ensure that you are familiar with the new system and that the records migrated from the DRRS files meet your expectations. Additionally, please ensure you have gained the consensus of the team head/FH on the sign-off. With this email, I kindly request your formal sign-off for the new system.

In the event that any gaps are identified in the records within the system, we will follow the Group ILM procedure to resolve them. This process requires the approval of FH, followed by raising a JIRA ticket for the necessary fixes. The team will allocate the appropriate resources to support us through this process. This will also be the standard procedure (BAU) whenever we need to add, remove, or edit anything on this system going forward.

For your reference, the full procedure is available here. Should you require any changes or need further assistance with the process, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. As the process involves some technical aspects, I am happy to provide additional support, i.e., help you prepare the file for the changes and raise the JIRA ticket.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,

Scope and Accuracy of the Report: Your current report includes remittance transactions, but the new scope seems to be expanding, potentially leading to over-reporting. It's capturing all significant fund movements at the account level, which might include transactions not required by law. This broader approach may not align with legal requirements and could result in more information being reported than necessary.

Need for Clear Guidelines: You're seeking specific guidelines regarding the types of transactions that should be included in the report. It's essential to have these guidelines to ensure your report aligns with anti-money laundering (AML) laws and regulations.

Senior Management Approval: Ensuring that senior management agrees with these guidelines is crucial. Any changes or interpretations in AML reporting must have the backing of senior leadership for effective implementation and adherence.

You're asking for advice on refining the scope of the transactions to be reported and for confirmation from senior management on this approach. This will help you have a clear, compliant path forward for your reporting.
